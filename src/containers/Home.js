        <p>
          I'm comfortable throughout the stack, but my passion lies in the back end, at the intersection of code and functionality. I currently write software at the coding cohort DigitalCrafts in Houston.

          â€‹Outside of code, I like to create in other ways. From <a href="#" target="_blank">making music</a> to <a href="#" target="_blank">coaching a highschool wrestling team</a>, I'm always trying new ways of expressing and involving myself. I also enjoy meditating, listening to music, and helping out my community.
