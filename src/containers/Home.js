          <p>
            I enjoy learning new things everyday, and there is so much I learn from code. I enjoy working on the front end of projects, but I focus on mostly back end implementation. I always learn better ways to write clean code. I started programming in Highschool and recently graduated from DigitalCrafts, a code bootcamp located in downtown Houston.

          â€‹  Outside of code, I enjoy <a href="https://www.fivetrackmind.com" target="_blank">making music</a>, playing videogames, and going out with friends.
